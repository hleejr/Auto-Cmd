## Project Structure

```bash
ðŸ“‚ Autocmd
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ autocmd.go
â”œâ”€â”€ git.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ go.sum
â””â”€â”€ go.mod
```

## Getting Started

Run each command line-by-line in your terminal to set up the utility:

```bash
$ cd ~/go/src
$ git clone https://github.com/hleejr/Auto-Commit.git
$ cd makesite
$ git remote rm origin
```
Then add the link to your repository as the new origin

## Utility Usage
When you have multiple shell commands needed for various setups, AutoCmd makes use of textfiles to run multiple commands with just one shell entry. The one example I included is a text file for git commands to create a git commit. However, by creating a new ".txt" file and adding the desired demands, with newlines after each entry, any combination of shell commands should be compatible.
